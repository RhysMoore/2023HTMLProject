    <font size="5px">Getting involved in the hobby to start is quite easy, simply attending an event and expressing
    interest will be enough for many groups to provide loaner equipment for you to use until you can purchase your own
    piece by piece. Many groups have basic attendance requirements and may have membership dues.</font>

<p>
    <font size="5px">A hobby like this one is always in need of new members and many groups are out there just waiting
        to be found. So find them the best way, attend reenactments, find an era you have an interest in and search for
        groups or events in your area and the reenactors will surely be thrilled to talk! </font>
