    <font size="5px"> Many events and groups will be based on one of two basic categories, civilian and military
        reenacting. The former seeks to show how wider society may have looked and acted during a certain time period,
        it allows reenactors more freedom in their individual portrayal but is usually limited by factors such as the
        environment and terrain in the local area which best fit a certain theme or era.</font>

    <font size="5px">Military reenacting portrays military life and combat from a specific conflict or era.
    Often this is the more expensive category as it involves equipment and weapon purchases if one wants their own
    private kit. What events for this group look like can also vary from small tactical events where groups
    will battle without being based on a single historical one to campaign events where groups will camp and march
    along the route of a historic military campaign.</font>
