    <font size="5px"> Reenacting at its core is a hobby, one dedicated the recreation of a historical era or topic
        for the purpose of education while also being a fun hobby. Reenactors participate in a myriad of events and
        activities ranging in purpose and execution. Some events are dedicated entirely to education.</font>
