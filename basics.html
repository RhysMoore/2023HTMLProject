    <font size="5px"> Reenacting at its core is a hobby, one dedicated the recreation of a historical era or topic
        for the purpose of education while also being a fun hobby. Reenactors participate in a myriad of events and
        activities ranging in purpose and execution. Some events are dedicated entirely to education or to
        a more casual setting had more for the reenactors enjoyment.</font>

    <font size="4px"> Reenactors use the hobby as a medium of education. At many events they will camp or have stations
        in public areas so the general public can ask them questions and learn about the era or topic they portray
        with an engaging experiance.
        It also gives the reenactors a chance to expand their own knowledge when people ask them about a topic they may
        find they want to learn more about</font>
